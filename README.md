# Natural-Disaster-Detection-With-Computer-Vision
Algorithm:-
•	In this project, deep learning algorithm VGG16-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is used for building the network and I get 95% accuracy in 48 epochs.

•	ReLu & SoftMax activation function are use.

•	The compilation of the model is done with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer to get the specified minimum learning rate.

 About:-

•	In this project, it can automatically detect natural disasters (earthquakes, flood, wildfires, cyclones/hurricanes) with 95% accuracy in videos or pictures and also with a webcam by using Keras, Computer Vision (OpenCV), and Deep Learning.
